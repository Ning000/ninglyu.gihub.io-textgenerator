# textgenerator
This is a auto Markovian-tweets program which can consume a text file with sentences and produce a tweet automatically. 
Store the text that you want to learn from into the "sample.txt"
Then run "main.cpp" to see the result.

Attention: It can only read one paragraph text and cannot adjust the length of the generated text.

For example: 

You can get:
We the People of the United States,in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility,provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

When you put the US constitution into the sample.
